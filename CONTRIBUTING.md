## Branch Strategy

We use a **two-branch architecture** to separate code from generated content:

### `main` branch
**Purpose**: Source code, scripts, and configuration

**Contains**:
- TypeScript scripts (`scripts/`)
- React components (`src/`)
- Configuration files (`docusaurus.config.ts`, `package.json`, etc.)
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- Documentation tooling and build system

**For**: Developers working on documentation infrastructure, scripts, and site features

### `content` branch
**Purpose**: Generated documentation content from Notion CMS

**Contains**:
- Markdown documentation (`docs/`)
- Translations (`i18n/`)
- Images (`static/images/`)

**For**: Content automatically generated from Notion - **not for direct editing**

## Contributing to Code

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/digidem/comapeo-docs.git
cd comapeo-docs

# Install dependencies
bun i

# Fetch content for local development
git fetch origin content
git checkout origin/content -- docs/ i18n/ static/images/

# Start development server
bun dev
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your code changes** (src/, scripts/, .github/, etc.)

3. **Test locally** with content:
   ```bash
   # If you need fresh content
   git fetch origin content
   git checkout origin/content -- docs/ i18n/ static/images/

   # Test your changes
   bun dev
   bun run build
   bun test
   ```

4. **Push changes** and create PR targeting `main`:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name

   # Create PR via GitHub CLI
   gh pr create --base main
   ```

### Local Development Tips

**Option 1: Use Content Branch** (Recommended - Fast)
```bash
git fetch origin content
git checkout origin/content -- docs/ i18n/ static/images/
bun dev
```

**Option 2: Generate from Notion** (Requires API access)
```bash
# Setup .env with Notion credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Add NOTION_API_KEY and DATABASE_ID

# Generate content
bun notion:fetch
bun dev
```

**Option 3: Git Worktree** (For multi-branch work)
```bash
# Create worktree for content branch
mkdir -p worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/content content

# Work in both directories simultaneously
cd worktrees/content  # View/explore content
cd ../..              # Work on code
```

## Contributing to Content

### ⚠️ Important: Content is Managed via Notion

Direct edits to the `content` branch are **not recommended** because:
- Content is automatically generated from Notion CMS
- Manual changes will be overwritten on next sync
- Content workflow is managed by automation

### To Update Content

**Primary Method** - Edit in Notion CMS:
1. Update content in Notion database
2. Trigger `Sync Notion Docs` workflow via GitHub Actions
3. Review changes in staging deployment (GitHub Pages)
4. Manually trigger production deployment when ready

### Emergency Content Hotfix

If immediate content fix is needed before Notion sync:

1. **Create branch from content**:
   ```bash
   git checkout content
   git pull origin content
   git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-content-fix
   ```

2. **Make minimal required changes**:
   ```bash
   # Edit specific files only
   git add docs/specific-file.md
   git commit -m "hotfix: fix critical typo in installation guide"
   ```

3. **Create PR targeting content branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/urgent-content-fix
   gh pr create --base content
   ```

4. **⚠️ Important**: Also update Notion to prevent reversion on next sync

5. **Document hotfix**: Explain why emergency fix was needed in PR description

  - [ ] Branch name descriptive (feat/*, fix/*, docs/*, etc.)
  - [ ] No merge conflicts with base branch

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run on PR creation
2. **Maintainer review** - may request changes
3. **Approval** - at least one maintainer approval required
4. **Merge** - Squash and merge (preferred) or standard merge

### After PR is Merged

- Feature branch is automatically deleted
- Changes deploy to staging automatically
- Production deployment is manual (maintainers only)

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for new files
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use semicolons
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use async/await over promises

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- PascalCase for component names

### File Naming

- **React components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `HomepageFeatures.tsx`)
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `notion-fetch.ts`)
- **Documentation**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `contributing-guidelines.md`)
- **Utilities**: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `imageProcessor.ts`)

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

If critical issues arise after merging the two-branch architecture changes, follow these steps to rollback safely.

### When to Rollback

Consider rollback if:
- Production deployments are consistently failing
- Content is not being synced properly to `content` branch
- Developers are blocked and cannot work around the issue
- Data integrity is at risk

### Pre-Rollback Steps

Before executing rollback:

1. **Assess Impact**: Determine if issue affects production, staging, or development only
2. **Stop Workflows**: Pause all content workflows in GitHub Actions UI to prevent mid-rollback conflicts:
   - Sync Notion Docs
   - Translate Notion Docs
   - Clean All Generated Content
   - Fetch All Content from Notion for Testing
3. **Notify Team**: Post announcement in team communication channels with:
   - Issue description
   - Rollback timeline
   - Expected impact on work in progress

### Rollback Procedure

**Option 1: Quick Rollback (Recommended for emergencies)**

```bash
# 1. Stop all content workflows via GitHub Actions UI
# 2. Reset main branch to backup
git fetch origin main-backup
git push origin main-backup:main --force

# 3. Optionally delete content branch (can be recreated later)
git push origin --delete content

# 4. Verify main branch
git fetch origin main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Option 2: Careful Rollback (Preserves content branch)**

```bash
# 1. Stop all content workflows via GitHub Actions UI
# 2. Create rollback branch for investigation
git checkout main
git checkout -b rollback/two-branch-architecture-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin rollback/two-branch-architecture-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Reset main branch to backup
git fetch origin main-backup
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main-backup
git push origin main --force

# 4. Keep content branch for analysis
# (Do not delete - can be examined later)
```

### Developer Cleanup After Rollback

All developers must update their local repositories:

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch --all --prune

# 2. If on main branch
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# 3. If on feature branch, rebase onto new main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase origin/main

# 4. Clean up local content files (they'll be tracked again)
git clean -fd

# 5. Reinstall dependencies if needed
bun install
```

### Post-Rollback Actions

After rollback is complete:

1. **Verify Systems**:
   - [ ] Production site builds and deploys successfully
   - [ ] Staging site builds and deploys successfully
   - [ ] Content sync workflows run without errors
   - [ ] Developers can run `bun dev` successfully

2. **Document Failure**:
   - Create detailed incident report in GitHub issue
   - Document what went wrong and why rollback was necessary
   - Collect logs and error messages for analysis
   - Tag issue with `incident`, `rollback`, and `two-branch-architecture`

3. **Plan Remediation**:
   - Schedule team meeting to discuss failure and solutions
   - Create new implementation plan addressing identified issues
   - Set up testing checklist for next attempt
   - Consider staging environment testing before production rollout

### Quick Reference - Emergency Command

For immediate emergencies (use with caution):

```bash
# ⚠️  WARNING: This force-pushes and may lose work
git push origin main-backup:main --force
```

**After running this command**:
- Notify team immediately
- Follow "Developer Cleanup" steps above
- Complete "Post-Rollback Actions" checklist

### Rollback Prevention

To minimize rollback risk in future:

- Test architecture changes in staging environment first
- Create integration tests for deployment workflows
- Document all workflow modifications thoroughly
- Maintain up-to-date runbooks for common issues
- Establish monitoring and alerting for deployment failures
