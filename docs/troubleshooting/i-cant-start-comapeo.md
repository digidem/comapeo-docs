For [Version Data]


:::note üëá On this Page
:::
# **Make sure you have CoMapeo installed on your phone or computer.**


Follow the instructions for [Installing CoMapeo](?tab=t.5eei5rul4qk3).


# **Clear application cache data (CoMapeo Mobile only)**


On CoMapeo Mobile, you can clear the application cache using the Android system settings. Note that clearing the application ‚Äúcache‚Äù is very different from clearing the application ‚Äústorage‚Äù. Applications typically use the cache to store non-permanent data to improve app experience and it is generally safe to remove that data.


_TODO: instructions for how to get to the cache data settings_


Once the cache data is cleared. Restart the application.


# **Restart the device and try opening the application again**


_TODO: blurb about why this sometimes works?_


# **Make sure your device has enough free space available**


_TODO: blurb about why this is necessary_


If none of the previously listed options work, there are more drastic measures that can be taken to potentially solve the issue:


# **Uninstall and reinstall the application**


It is important to note that uninstalling CoMapeo means **losing all the data you have collected so far**. You can only recover this data if you have previously exchanged with another device.
