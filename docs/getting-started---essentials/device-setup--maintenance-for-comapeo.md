Here you will learn what to do on your <img src="/images/emojis/android-head_3d_182d654c7a9e6c2b_63077062.png" alt="android" className="emoji" style={{display: "inline", height: "1.2em", width: "auto", verticalAlign: "text-bottom", margin: "0 0.1em"}} /> Android smartphone or tablet phone (outside of CoMapeo) to get the best performance from it as you start to use it.

✅ **Check Battery life**: To optimize battery life during data collection use flight mode. If possible bring an external battery pack and phone charging cable to recharge whilst in the field. Also try and make sure that other apps are not running in the background, draining your battery.


✅ **Manage and maintain storage**
CoMapeo isn’t a large app, and the observation data (GPS coordinates and notes) don’t take up very much space. However if you start taking lots of photographs, or recording audio, these can begin to fill up your memory.

- Manage your storage use by deleting unwanted apps within Settings > Apps > Sort by "Last used" or "Size".

- If there are a lot of photos and videos in your phone gallery, consider moving them to a different media storage device.

### Protect your phone against physical damage


**Smartphone cases.**


Choose a case that offers protection from exposure to water, accidental drops, and general abrasion.  Adding a screen protector is recommended


**Weather and Climate Considerations.**


Common experiences of using smartphone in high exposure environments

- High heat → Device overheats and shuts off
- Extreme cold → Accelerated battery drain
- High Humidity → Accelerated corrosion of device parts, especially charging ports
- Rain → Moisture may seep in ports affecting charging ports and in severe cases the chipsets inside the device
