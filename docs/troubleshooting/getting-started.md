The **Quick Start Guide** is intended to help you install and test the basic, out-of-the-box functionality of Mapeo in order to evaluate whether it will be a good fit. This section will not touch on all features or customization of the tools.


The [**Complete Reference Guide**](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/welcome) below includes critical information about how to design and implement a project using Mapeo as well as detailed guides for setup and customization of the tools. We recommend using it for starting a new initiative or as a training reference.

# **New Roles**


![FAQ_temps%281%29.png](/images/gettingstarted_0.png)


We have introduced two roles to CoMapeo: **Project Coordinator** and **Project Participant**. 


In future updates Coordinators will have greater control over project setup and permissions.


> ![Vector-1.png](/images/gettingstarted_1.png)  
>   
> **What is a Project Coordinator?**  
>   
> The device that creates a project becomes a Project Coordinator. Other devices can be invited as Coordinators to the project when invited by an existing Project Coordinator. Project Coordinators should be trusted devices as they are in charge of managing project details and inviting devices to a project.  
>   
> Coordinators can:  
>   
> - Take and share observations  
>   
> - Edit observations created by others  
>   
> - Invite devices to the project (to be Coordinators or Participants)  
>   
> - Manage project details  
>   
> - Import config (categories)  
>   
> - Leave project


> ![Vector.png](/images/gettingstarted_2.png)  
>   
> **What is a Project Participant?**  
>   
> A Project Participant is any device that has joined the Project. They can create, sync, and share observations but cannot manage the project’s settings or users.  
>   
> Participants can:  
>   
> - Take and share observations  
>   
> - Edit observations they created  
>   
> - View project data  
>   
> - Leave project  
>   
> Participants **cannot**:  
>   
> - Edit observations created by others  
>   
> - Invite other devices to the project  
>   
> - Import config (categories)  
>   
> - Edit project details (e.g. project name)


> **When do you select roles?**  
> When you first open and use the app your device does not have a role.  
>   
> Your device can be invited to a project as a Participant or a Coordinator.  If you create a project, then your device automatically is the first Coordinator for that project.

# Onboarding


![Screen_Shot_2024-09-05_at_10.39.03_AM.png](/images/gettingstarted_3.png)


There are 3 steps to Onboarding:

1. **Welcome Screen**
You will be invited to [Get Started] and asked for device permissions upon startup.
2. **Metrics & Privacy Policy**
The app will present the metrics it collects, and you can choose to [opt in] or [opt out]. This can also be changed later via **Settings > Data Privacy**.
    1. See Privacy Policy in English : [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d8f413bbbf374a2092655b89b9ceb2b0)
3. **Device Naming**
You must enter a name for the device. This is the name other devices will see when inviting you to project, and will display in the list of project members.

After completing the above steps, CoMapeo is ready to use on your device.

# **First Use of the App**


![FAQ_temps%283%29.png](/images/gettingstarted_4.png)


After Onboarding, CoMapeo will always start in the Map view. You may enter the app and begin exploring its features. When you use CoMapeo for the first time, your device is not part of a project and is not assigned any roles (Coordinator or Participant.)


> **What can I do without being part of a project?**  
> - Create and save observations  
>   
> - Import configuration and adjust preferences  
>   
> - Share individual observations via the device menu  
>   
> - Access settings like Security, Language, and Coordinates


> **Current limitations**  
> - Any observations taken before you are on a project will not be saved when you join or create a project later. **All your observations will be lost!**  
>   
> - When not on a project you cannot connect with other devices and sync.


> ### **FOR TRAINING**


In order for users to not lose data, it would be best to create a project and invite all participants to that project before they start collecting any data.
