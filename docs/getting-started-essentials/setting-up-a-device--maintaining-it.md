# Setting up your phone to use CoMapeo


Here you will learn what to do on your phone (outside of CoMapeo) to get the best performance from it as you start to use it.


### ✔️ Checklist


:::note ✅ Turn on GPS
Make sure your Location / GPS is turned on on your phone. You can usually find this in the quickfind menu, located by pulling down from the top of the screen.

✅ **Check Battery life**: To optimize battery life during data collection use flight mode. If possible bring an external battery pack and phone charging cable to recharge whilst in the field. Also try and make sure that other apps are not running in the background, draining your battery.


✅ **Manage and maintain storage**
CoMapeo isn’t a large app, and the observation data (GPS coordinates and notes) don’t take up very much space. However if you start taking lots of photographs, or recording audio, these can begin to fill up your memory.

- Manage your storage use by deleting unwanted apps within Settings > Apps > Sort by "Last used" or "Size".

- If you have lots of photos and videos in your phone gallery, consider moving them to an SD card or other storage.
