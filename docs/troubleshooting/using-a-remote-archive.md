# What is a Remote Archive?


A **Remote Archive** is a dedicated server that allows projects to automatically back up their observations whenever connected to the internet.

- Any device can be considered a server as long as it is in perpetual state of being available to exchange observations.
- Internet connectivity is required to both add a Remote Archive and to exchange with it.
- Only Coordinators can enable a Remote Archive, and once enabled Participants can see it as part of the participants list.
- When enabled, all new collaborators that opt-in to exchange their observations will automatically be doing so with the Remote Archive.

# Step 1: Generate a Remote Archive URL


[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH]


â€”


Familiarity and comfort with coding will help with generating a Remote Archive URL.


|   | Step 1 Using a web browser, go to https://captain.comapeo.cloud                                                                                                                                |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   | **Step 2** Enter with the password **4F0fm!z&i^aHbQ**                                                                                                                                          |
|   | **Step 3** Click on `**Apps**` on the sidebar                                                                                                                                                  |
|   | **Step 4** Under `**Create A New App**` select `**One-Click Apps/Database**`                                                                                                                   |
|   | **Step 5** Select `**CoMapeo Archive Server**`                                                                                                                                                 |
|   | **Step 6** Set the `**App Name**` which will become the subdomain for the Archive Server For example: `**alianzaceibo**` will become `**https://alianzaceibo.comapeo.cloud**`                  |
|   | **Step 7** No need to change the `**Docker Image**`                                                                                                                                            |
|   | **Step 8** Under `**Token for authenticating API request**` itâ€™s good practice to generate a new token, use a [**token generator**](https://it-tools.tech/token-generator) to do so            |
|   | **Step 9** Add a `**Friendly server name**` which can be anything                                                                                                                              |
|   | **Step 10** Set the `**number of projects allowed to register**` which will depend on the use case, if youâ€™re creating an archive server for an organization it will likely have many projects |
|   | **Step 11** Finally click `**Deploy**` which will spin the new Archive Server                                                                                                                  |
|   | **Step 12** On `**Apps**` search for your newly created app and select it                                                                                                                      |
|   | **Step 13** Click on `**Enable HTTPS**` wait until itâ€™s done                                                                                                                                   |
|   | **Step 14** Select `**Force HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS**` (this is optional really)                                                                                        |
|   | **Step 15** Select `**Websocket Support**` (this is IMPORTANT)                                                                                                                                 |
|   | **Step 16** Click `**Save and Restart**`                                                                                                                                                       |
|   | **Step 17** You new CoMapeo Remote Archive Server should be running and ready to use on the application Test it out with a dummy project before sharing with partners                          |

## Exchanging with a Remote Archive


If enabled and connected to the internet, Remote Archive will automatically backup every time a device starts an Exchange.


Attention: On CoMapeo Mobile 1.2.0 it is not possible to not exchange with the Remote Archive but this is a feature that may come in the future.

## Removing a Remote Archive


It is not currently possible to remove a Remote Archive from a Project once added. We anticipate having the ability to remove a Remote Archive available in late 2025.

- When it becomes available, only Coordinators will be able to add and remove a Remote Archive from their projects
- In this version and in the future, participants cannot remove the Remote Archive from the project.

## Troubleshooting

## Coming Soon


In the coming year, improvements to Remote Archives will include:

- Allowing Coordinators to remove a Remote Archive
- Making it easier process to add a Remote Archive
