# Why invite collaborators to your projects?


When mapping on your own, there are three ways to start collaborating with others using CoMapeo.

- Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project
- Starting a New Project
- Joining an Existing Project

# Inviting a Collaborator to My Solo Project


[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH]


When mapping on your own, your first project is simply My Solo Project to which you can gather a limitless amount of observations. If you’d like to share observations in My Solo Project using CoMapeo’s Exchange feature, then you will first need to give the project a name. Once the project has been successfully renamed, then you are ready to invite devices to this renamed project and use the Exchange feature.


|   | Step 1 Go to the Menu screen to start.                                                                                         |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   | **Step 2** Tap on the Invite button in the Current Project card.                                                               |
|   | **Step 3** Review the quick summary about inviting collaborators and tap on Name My Project when ready.                        |
|   | **Step 4** On Name My Project, enter a clear and concise project name and tap on Save when done.                               |
|   | **Step 5** When the project is successfully renamed and saved, your project is then ready to Invite Devices for collaboration. |

# Starting a New Project


[VIDEO WALKTHROUGH]


In the case where you want to share any observations from My Solo Project, but would rather collaborate with another device on a separate project, then Start a New Project.


|   | Step 1 Go to the Menu screen to start.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   | **Step 2** Tap on All Projects in the list below the Current Project card.                                                                                                                             |
|   | **Step 3** On the All Project screen, tap on the Start New Project button.                                                                                                                             |
|   | **Step 4** Enter a clear and concise project name and tap on Create when done.                                                                                                                         |
|   | **Step 5** When the project is successfully named and created, your new project is ready to Invite Devices for collaboration and My Solo Project will still be available from the All Projects screen. |
