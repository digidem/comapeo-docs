Projects are how you organize your mapping work. They can be used for solo mapping or for collaboration with a team.


When you first open CoMapeo, can begin collecting observations in your own project right away.  you can edit its name and description to help you stay organized.


To collaborate with teammates,  rename your project and invite other devices to join.


Roles:? do we talk about this here ir in Managing a team.


Coordinators can invite collaborators, manage settings, and enable features like Remote Archive. Participants can contribute Observations and Tracks


> 💁🏽 💡 **Tip**: Since CoMapeo v5, you can now have **multiple projects** on the same device without losing data


> 👉🏽 Since v5 released in October 2025, CoMapeo supports **multiple projects**
