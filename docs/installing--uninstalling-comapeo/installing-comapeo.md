**Step 1: Find CoMapeo on the Playstore**


Open Google Playstore and search for CoMapeo, created by Awana Digital.


_Alternative Option: You can also download the .apk for_ [_CoMapeo from our website_](https://awana.digital/comapeo)_. However if you download the .apk the app will not be automatically updated with new features and bug fixes when we make new releases. We recommend installing CoMapeo the Playstore if possible._

**Step 4: Permission to take photos**


CoMapeo will ask for permission to take photos, which is one of the main features of the app. If you don‚Äôt grant it permission, you will not be able to use this feature (but other parts of the app will still work).

**Step 5a: Permission to access location**


CoMapeo needs to access your device‚Äôs location in order to collect GPS coordinates to save with your data. If you don‚Äôt grant permission you will be able to use other features of the app, and give it access later, or enter GPS coordinates manually.


Newer Android versions appear like the image here, in this case, choose Precise location otherwise your data collection might be compromised.

**Step 8: Name your device**


You must enter a name for your device. This is the name other devices will see when inviting you to project, and will display in the list of project members. It does not have to be your name, but if you are using CoMapeo as part of a team, on a shared project, we recommend that you get an agreement that works for everyone about how you are going to name the devices.


For example you might want to use the name of the person using that particular device, or you might want to use something anonymous for safety issues (like Mapper 1), or you might want to put a sticker on each phone with its name if they are being used by multiple people.
