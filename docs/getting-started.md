The **Quick Start Guide** is intended to help you install and test the basic, out-of-the-box functionality of Mapeo in order to evaluate whether it will be a good fit. This section will not touch on all features or customization of the tools.


The [**Complete Reference Guide**](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/welcome) below includes critical information about how to design and implement a project using Mapeo as well as detailed guides for setup and customization of the tools. We recommend using it for starting a new initiative or as a training reference.
